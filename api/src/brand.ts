 * The product's public identity in one place: its name, the hosted origin, the addresses people write to, and the
 * names integrations see. The API, dashboard and support Worker import this file; `bun run sdk` (in api/) copies it
 * verbatim to sdk/src/brand.ts and mcp/src/brand.ts, so edit only api/src/brand.ts. It imports nothing, so every
 * package compiles it.
 *
 * Bane became Nightmail (nightmail.com). The hosted service is on nightmail.com; bane.mx, its earlier domain, is in
 * `previousDomains` and stays served (API, SNS feedback, unsubscribe links; GETs redirect). A name a customer may already
 * have (key prefix, DNS proof, header, scope, cookie) stays accepted until the cutover, which removes them all at once
 * (each site is marked "remove after rename cleanup"). Infrastructure names (Workers, buckets, SES resources) are not here.
