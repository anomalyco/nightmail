        <p>Receiving needs an MX record, and a domain can only send its mail to one place. So {productName} suggests a free subdomain, usually <code>reply.yourdomain.com</code>: addresses there, such as <code>support@reply.yourdomain.com</code>, come to {productName}, while mail to <code>yourdomain.com</code> itself keeps going to your current mailboxes.</p>
        <p>{productName} receives on the domain itself only when its MX record already points to {productName}, or when you choose it on the domain’s page. Choosing the root moves all of the domain’s mail to {productName}, so the page asks first. Onboarding and the domain’s page always show the host {productName} chose, with the reason.</p>

      <Section title="What a ritual is">
        <p>A ritual is a short script that runs on every email sent to the addresses it’s attached to. It reads the email and decides what happens: junk it, label it, post it to Slack, send it to a webhook, forward it. It can’t do anything else: no loops, no clock, no network calls of its own, so it always finishes and does the same thing for the same email.</p>

Pick one, fill in one or two fields (a Slack channel, the senders to block) and choose its addresses; Save turns it on. A Slack, Discord or webhook URL you paste there becomes an endpoint, stored encrypted.</p>
        <p>Each one writes an ordinary ritual, shown in the list as its sentence, like <em>Post new mail to support in Slack</em>, with when it last matched and a switch that turns it off without detaching it. <strong>Edit as code</strong> opens its script; saving a change there makes it your own script.

        <p>A ritual runs only on mail to the addresses it’s attached to.

Up to {RITUALS_PER_ADDRESS} rituals run on an address, in order. The first one that acts stops the rest, unless its <strong>Run the next one too</strong> is on; ready-made rituals always have it on and run before your scripts.</p>
