// CLS gate: cumulative layout shift on every main dashboard page, light and dark, on a cold full load and on in-app
// navigation, over a throttled network with slow API responses that arrive out of order (web fonts load before any text,
// the same way every run; CLS_FONTS=late delays them instead); the main pages again on a
// phone (390 × 844, touch: the tab bar, cards and native selects). Fails when any page's CLS
// exceeds 0.001 (or a page errors). The longest task during each in-app navigation is reported, not gated: on CI's
// shared runner the composer and rituals chunks measured 105–179 ms between runs of the same page, too close to a
// 200 ms budget to fail on without flakes.
//
// From app/: bun run cls (builds first), or node scripts/cls.mjs against an existing build.
//   CLS_ONLY=<regex>   only pages whose name matches
//   CLS_WORKERS=<n>    pages measured at once (default: 5 per CPU, at most 32; most of a page's time is network wait)
//   CLS_PG_URL=<url>   Postgres admin URL (CI); otherwise Docker or a local initdb (see cls-fixture.mjs)
//   CLS_CHROME=<path>  Chrome executable; otherwise the installed Google Chrome
//   CLS_SHOTS=1        screenshot every page, not only failing ones
//   CLS_PHONE=0        skip the phone pass
//   CLS_FONTS=late     deliver web fonts 1.8 s late, to measure the fallback-to-web-font swap
//   CLS_DENSITY=1      also read each page's text density in the same run (density.mjs) into .cls/density.json;
//                      =only measures density alone (cold loads, no throttling, no CLS gate): node scripts/density.mjs
// Writes .cls/report.json (every shift with its source elements), .cls/summary.md (also appended to
// $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY) and a screenshot per failing page with the shifted elements outlined.
//
// Live rituals (`live`): on Driftwood's rituals page, an agent's API key saves the open ritual once the page has settled
// (`apply`: the change lands in the editor and the save bar names who made it), or after a keystroke in the editor
// (`conflict`: the card offering their version or yours opens above the save bar). The pages' long poll on
// /v1/rituals/version is always open by design, so it is left out of the network-idle wait.
//
// Support chat: the page loads, then the Help button opens the chat (the scripted demo conversation) and the agent's
// greeting streams in to its end; in-app, the chat stays open on Overview while the sidebar link goes to Logs (on a
// phone, where the chat is a sheet over the page, the tab bar's link closes it).
//
// Dialogs (`dialog`): once the page has settled, the control whose text starts with `dialog` opens its dialog (a bottom
// sheet on a phone), and the measurement covers the load and the open dialog together.
//
// Every measurement also checks the masked addresses on its page (lib/private-address.ts): nothing of a seeded address
// beyond its first two characters is in the page's text, a title, a label or a link before it is revealed, and on a
// cold desktop load, hovering the first few reveals them without anything moving, and so does turning privacy mode off
// with ⇧P (then on again, which masks them as before).
//
// CLS sums every layout-shift entry without recent input: stricter than the browser's largest session window. In-app
// navigation clicks with an untrusted event, so no shift is excused as following user input. Measurement ends when
// no request is in flight, fonts are loaded and the page has rendered and gone idle twice in a row; there are no
// fixed sleeps, and polling pages settle between polls.
