# Fixing copy and density: the agent playbook

Goal: every page as easy as possible to understand. Short, plain copy; nothing said twice; no figure shown twice.
Shorten, never hide: numbers, limits, prices and consequences stay.

## Loop

1. **Measure.** From `app/`: `bun run copy-lint --all` (every string finding, worst files first) and
   `DENSITY_OUT=<dir> bun run density` (`<dir>/summary.md`, `report.json` and an annotated screenshot per page and
   device: duplicates magenta, detail to disclose blue, text that adds nothing purple, long blocks orange, explanations
   with no action yellow). `CLS_ONLY=<regex>` measures only matching pages.
2. **Pick the worst page** by density score. Read its screenshot and findings, then the copy-lint findings in the
   files that render it.
3. **Fix, in this order:**
   - **Duplicate information** (`dup-value`, `dup-fact`, `dup-text`, `dup-label`): keep the one place a reader looks
     for it and remove or link the other. A global element (the sidebar's score, a banner) wins over a page's copy.
   - **Detail shown by default** (`disclosure`): keep the summary figure and open the detail from it (a dialog or an
     expander). Every moved number keeps a click path, at most 2 clicks away.
   - **Text that adds nothing** (`restate-value`, `repeated-unit`, `obvious-helper`, `intro-restates`): delete it.
   - **Long blocks and inert explanations:** cut to one short sentence next to the control it explains; move
     reference detail to the docs and link it.
   - **String findings:** shorten to the limit for its kind (`LIMITS` in `copy-lint.mjs`), drop filler and hedges, use
     the glossary's term, digits, sentence case, and don't restate the heading or label.
4. **Check.** Rerun both linters (a clean local run drops fixed findings from the baselines), `bun run build`, and
   `bun run cls` if a layout changed (CLS ≤ 0.001, phone layout holds).
5. **Ship.** One page per PR with the before and after screenshots and scores, and the updated baselines.

## Density rules

| Id | Finds | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dup-value` | The same figure twice on one screen (the score in the sidebar and in Overview) | Show it once |
| `dup-fact` | One fact as two figures, matched by label (`FACTS`: emails in 24 h and the daily limit's count) | Show one, or a different fact (what's left) |
| `dup-label` | Two sections with the same heading | Merge them |
| `dup-text` | The same sentence or explanation twice | Say it once |
| `disclosure` | A summary figure with 5+ rows or 40+ words of detail right under it | Open the detail from the figure |
| `restate-value` | A caption repeating the figure beside it (“0.00% bounced” under “Bounced 0.00%”) | Drop the caption |
| `repeated-unit` | The same word on every row of a column (“3 messages”) | Say it once in the header |
| `obvious-helper` | Helper text repeating its field's label, or under a name, email or search field | Drop it |
| `intro-restates` | A section intro leading with its heading's words | Drop or rewrite it |
| `long-block` | A text block over 25 words | Cut it, or move it to the docs |
| `inert` | An explanation of 15+ words with nothing to act on near it | Put it next to its control, or cut it |

## Glossary: one name per concept

| Use | Not |
| --- | --- |
| workspace | account, team, tenant (“account” is the person’s sign-in) |
| Hosted mail / your AWS account | shared, BYO, bring your own AWS |
| daily limit | quota, cap, sending limit (“SES quota” only for an AWS account’s own quota) |
| sender score | reputation score, health (“reputation” only for an SES account) |
| balance, add credit | funds, top up, wallet |
| address (receiving address when ambiguous) | inbound address, mailbox |
| agent inbox | sandbox mailbox, temp inbox |
| route, ritual, endpoint, omen, catch-all, trace | rule, script, destination, AI question |
| webhook | callback, hook |
| suppressed | blocked, blacklisted |
| subscribed / unsubscribed / unknown consent | opted in, confirmed |
| owners and admins | administrators, managers |

Style: lead with the outcome; one short sentence over two; errors say what went wrong and what to do, in one line.

## Exceptions

A finding that is right as it is (a legal phrase, a quoted API name): accept it with `--update-baseline` and say why
in the PR.
