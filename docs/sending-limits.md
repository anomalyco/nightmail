# How sending limits work (Hosted)

Hosted Nightmail gives each workspace a **sender score** (0–100) from the quality of what it sends. The score sets the **daily limit**. Nightmail stays out of the way unless something goes wrong: it **warns** first, then **holds marketing**, and **pauses** only for problems that put the shared pool at risk. These thresholds are public; how Nightmail detects abuse is not.

Everything here is in the API: `GET /v1/sender-score` (score, factors, `limit`, `standing`), the `account.standing.changed` webhook event, and `connection.standing` on `GET /v1/me`. Self-hosted and bring-your-own-AWS installations get the score for display only.

## Score → daily limit

| Score | Grade | Daily limit (rolling 24 h, recipients) | Per minute | Marketing per hour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calibrating (first 100 recipients) | – | 100 | 50 | 25 |
| under 65 | D, F | 100 | 50 | 25 |
| 65–69 | D | 200 | 50 | 50 |
| 70–74 | C | 500 | 50 | 125 |
| 75–79 | C | 1,000 | 50 | 250 |
| 80–84 | B | 2,000 | 100 | 500 |
| 85–89 | B | 5,000 | 250 | 1,250 |
| 90 and up | A, A+ | 10,000 | 500 | 2,500 |
| on request | – | 25,000 / 50,000 / 100,000 | up to 1,000 | limit ÷ 4 |

- **Calibrating:** a new workspace sends at 100 a day until 100 real recipients were accepted (simulator mail never counts) and 24 hours passed. The score then starts at 65 (200 a day) if the mail was good, lower if it was not.
- **Movement:** the score moves towards its target by at most **+5 a day** and **−10 a day**, so a clean sender roughly doubles its limit each day and reaches 10,000 about a week after calibrating, if it sends enough to prove it.
- **Hysteresis:** a limit drops a band only when the score is 2 points under the band's floor.
- **Per minute:** `clamp(limit ÷ 20, 50, 500)` per workspace, half of it per sending domain.
- **Transactional reserve:** marketing may use at most `limit − max(100, 10% of limit)`. A small sender always keeps 100 a day for receipts and password resets; while calibrating, all 100 are for transactional mail.
- **Grades:** A+ ≥ 95, A ≥ 90, B ≥ 80, C ≥ 70, D ≥ 60, F below.
- Lowering a limit applies to new mail at once. Mail already accepted is never recalled.

## What the score is made of

| Factor | Weight | Good (100) | Bad (0) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Complaints ÷ delivered | 30 | ≤ 0.01% | ≥ 0.3% |
| Spam screen rejections ÷ screened | 20 | ≤ 0.1% | ≥ 3% |
| Hard bounces to known recipients ÷ accepted | 15 | ≤ 0.5% | ≥ 5% |
| List quality: first-send bounces and suppression hits | 15 | ≤ 2% | ≥ 10% |
| Authentication: DKIM 40%, aligned SPF 30%, DMARC enforcing 30% | 10 | all three | none |
| Engagement: marketing unsubscribes ÷ delivered, lifted by clicks | 10 | ≤ 0.2% | ≥ 2% |

- A factor with nothing to measure is neutral: it drops out and the others are re-weighted.
- Evidence fades with a **30-day half-life**. Quality sets the ceiling; volume earns the way up: the target is `(n·Q + 250·60) ÷ (n + 250)`, where *n* is the faded volume. 100 perfect emails give 71; 1,000 give 92.
- Opens are ignored (mail privacy features inflate them).

## When something goes wrong: the ladder

Nightmail checks every 10 minutes. Every line needs a **count and a rate together**, so a few events never trip a small sender. Rates are over accepted mail in the window (24 hours of events against 48 hours of accepted mail, so late feedback is counted fairly).

| Signal | ① Warn | ② Restrict | ③ Pause |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Complaints | ≥ 0.05% and ≥ 2 in 24 h, or ≥ 0.05% and ≥ 3 in 7 days | ≥ 0.1% and ≥ 3 in 24 h | ≥ 0.3% and ≥ 5 in 24 h, or ≥ 0.15% and ≥ 10 in 7 days |
| Hard bounces | ≥ 2% and ≥ 10 in 24 h, or ≥ 1.5% and ≥ 10 in 7 days | marketing ≥ 4% and ≥ 25, or any mail ≥ 8% and ≥ 50, in 24 h | **transactional** mail ≥ 5% and ≥ 50 in 24 h |
| Spam screen rejections ÷ screened | ≥ 2% and ≥ 3 in 24 h | ≥ 5% and ≥ 10 in 24 h | ≥ 10% and ≥ 25 in 24 h |
| External | – | – | AWS paused the workspace's SES tenant; confirmed abuse |

A **notice** sits below Warn: a first complaint or a few bounces show on the dashboard, with no email.

| Step | You see | Mail | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Notice | A note on the score card | unchanged | unchanged |
| ① Warn | Overview card, a dot on the score, an email to owners and admins | unchanged | frozen (no rises) |
| ② Restrict | A banner on every page, an email | Campaigns pause and new marketing is refused (409 `MARKETING_HELD`). Transactional mail keeps flowing. | frozen |
| ③ Pause | A red banner on every page, an email | All sending stops (409 `HOSTED_SENDING_PAUSED`) and the workspace's SES tenants are disabled. Receiving, inboxes and the dashboard keep working. Queued mail is held for 72 hours, then canceled (`ACCOUNT_PAUSED`). | 0 |

Bounces alone hold marketing; they stop everything only when **transactional mail itself** bounces at 5% (and 50). Complaints, the spam screen, abuse and an AWS tenant pause stop everything.

## Getting back

| Step | By itself | Owner (dashboard, after the fix checklist) | Nightmail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ① Warn | clears after 24 hours under 80% of its line | – | – |
| ② Restrict | – | 24 hours after it started, once every 14 days, when the last 24 hours are under the warn line: marketing resumes at 50% of its allowance for 48 hours | a second restrict within 14 days |
| ③ Pause from transactional bounces | – | once every 30 days: the limit is 50% for 48 hours and marketing stays held for 24 hours | otherwise |
| ③ Any other pause | – | – | review only |

- A resume never restarts the limit at 100 a day. The 50% is of the limit before the resume, for 48 hours; another resume in that window keeps it there. Each pause leaves a **strike** for 90 days; the second caps the limit at 50% for 7 days, and the third needs a review for any resume.
- The owner action is `POST /v1/sender-score/release` (dashboard sessions, owners and admins); `standing.selfService` in `GET /v1/sender-score` says whether it is available, and when.

## Campaign list probe

A Hosted campaign with more than 100 recipients sends a **probe** first: the first `min(500, 10%)` recipients, at least 100. Release waits until the probe has gone out and ten more minutes for its feedback (`delivery.waiting.reason` is `list_probe`). More than 3% hard bounces or 2 complaints **quarantines** the campaign (paused, `LIST_QUALITY`); bounced addresses are suppressed and owners get an email. After the probe, a campaign still pauses at more than 2% bounces after 1,000 accepted or more than 0.08% complaints after 2,000. The owner can resume a quarantined campaign once; a second quarantine needs a review (409 `QUARANTINE_REVIEW_REQUIRED`). A quarantine never pauses the account.

## Content screen: how much text

Hosted mail is screened for smuggled advertising and scams before it is delivered. The screen reads the HTML's visible text and `alt` text, then each sentence of the text part that the HTML doesn't already say: a text part generated from the HTML counts once, and a text part that tells another story is screened in full.

| What | Limit | When it is checked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A message (`POST /v1/emails/send`, each item of `/v1/emails/batch`, replies and inbox sends, campaign tests) | **24,576 UTF-8 bytes** of screened text (24 KiB), 60 distinct link hosts | On submission |
| A campaign, screened **once** for all its recipients | **49,152 UTF-8 bytes** (48 KiB) of its own copy, placeholders unresolved, 60 link hosts | On send or schedule |
| A personalization value (`{{firstName}}`, a contact property) | **256 UTF-8 bytes**; no markup, control or reordering characters; links only to hosts the campaign links to or your verified sending domains | Fallbacks on send or schedule; contact values while the campaign prepares, before anyone is sent to |

Over a limit, the request is refused at once with 422 `CONTENT_TOO_LARGE_TO_SCREEN` and `error.details[0]` set to `{ screenedBytes, limitBytes }` (or `{ linkHosts, linkHostLimit }`); in a batch, `index` names the message and nothing in the batch is queued. A contact value that breaks a rule fails the campaign with `CAMPAIGN_VALUE_REJECTED` and names the placeholder, never the contact. A campaign the screen judges to be spam fails with `CONTENT_REJECTED_SPAM` before any recipient is sent to; every recipient counts as a screen rejection in the score. `POST /v1/emails/check` reports the measured size as the `screen-bytes` finding. Self-hosted installations set the limits with `JEV_MESSAGE_LIMIT_BYTES` and `JEV_CAMPAIGN_LIMIT_BYTES`.

## The `account.standing.changed` event

Subscribe a webhook to `account.standing.changed` to hear about every change of step, a campaign quarantine, and an owner's or Nightmail's release. `data` has `step`, `previousStep`, `reasons` (code, metric, value, count, threshold, minimum, window, message), `since`, `version`, `sequence` (per workspace, always increasing: ignore a sequence you have already seen), `marketingHeld`, `change` and `actor.kind` (`system`, `owner` or `operator`).
